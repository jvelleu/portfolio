		<p>U-M's Solar Car team is a multi-disiplanary orginization that requires not only engineering, but business and strategy as well. The entirely student-run org. operates on a multi-million dollar anual budget, which is entirely funded throught donations procured by student team-members. With over 70 members at any given time, the team required a standardized document that could not only be given out to potential sponsors and professional represent the org., but also unify the message and establish guidelines for sponsorship pitches.</p>
		
		<p>Previous documents had been attempted, but results were largely amaturish or ineffective.</p>

       <h2 style="display: inline;">Design:</h2>
       <p style="display: inline;">In collaboration with the team's Business Division, sponsorship "levels" were defined and key advantages of sponsoring the team were identified. Then, the layout for the document was designed to exist as a pdf and and printed as bound booklets.</p>
    </div>
	
	<div>
       <h2 style="display: inline;">Result:</h2>
       <p style="display: inline;">The Sponsorship Packet was instrumental in the team raising over 2 million dollars for the project cycle. In this time they placed 1st in the American Solar Challenge and 2nd in the World Solar Challenge.</p>
