	About: The Smart Materials &amp; Structures Design Lab at the University of Michigan works in collaboration with Gneral Motors to develop advanced automotive technologies. 
	
	Brief: Design an Inflatable Attachment hat is lightweight, stowable, and an adaptive constraint for a wide variety of objects that commonly exist with vehicle spaces.
	
	My Role: Lead Researcher for Inflatable Attachments
	
	Research: Attachemtnts of all sorts are used in vehicles. Anything from cup holders, to GPS mounts, to seatback pockets are used to hold the many objects
	
	Concept Generation: A wide variety of ideas were proposed and discussed with engineers at GM R&amp;D. At this stage, little regard to the feasability of creating these concpets was taken. Concepts were then  systematically downselects to a chosen direction. The selected cpncept was based off of inflatable achitectured popular in soft robtics. However, a unique actuation was developed by modifing this architecture and utilizing the interplay of this actuation with a rigid hosuing to creat a novel locking mechanism for the bending actuator.
	
	Prototyping: Prototypes were molded from silicon elastomers and the housing was 3D-printed.
	
	Result: The design has been co-patented by the design team and General Motors
