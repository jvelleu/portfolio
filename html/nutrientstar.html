				<p>Overview</p>
					<p> <a href="http://nutrientstar.org/">NutrientStar</a> is an <a href="https://www.edf.org/media/new-program-assesses-performance-fertilizer-management-tools">independent, 
						science-based program that reviews the performance of commercially available nutrient management tools”</a> that was launched by the <a href="https://www.edf.org/">Environmental Defense Fund</a> in 2016. Prior to launch, the program required a visual identity system that could translate across both physical and digital spaces.</p>
				<br>

				<p>Brief</p>
				<p>The initial task was to simply design the logo for the NutrientStar program. After a logo was selected, I was given further control to fully develop the supporting visual identity system.</p>

				<h2>Research</h2>
				
				<p>A literature review of recent agriculture related studies was conducted along with a survey of farmers in order to determine the target audience and define messaging; it was revealed that 3/4 of young growers use social media and a majority of this usage was to range with other farmers about ideas on increasing yield, pest control, etc. and farmers associated with terms such as ‘innovator,’ and ‘adaptability.’ On the visual design end, I conducted a simple review of visual stylings of similar services, products that could be potentially certified by the program, and organizations with similar names in order to understand the visual space that a logo would appear in, define application areas, and identify areas to avoid. This research was presented to the NutrientStar project team in order to establish buy-in for my design process and lay the groundwork for building credibility of my future design decisions.</p>

				<h2>Logo Design</h2>
				
				<p>For the initial round of concepts, I designed a wide array of logos in a variety different styles in order to identify the direction the team wanted to pursue further. Designs primarily focused on incorporating two elements: a star and a stalk of wheat, which is commonly associated with agricultural imagery. Through an iterative process of revisions and proposals to the higher-ups in the NutrientStar team, the design was down-selected to its final form.</p>

				<h2>Proposals</h2>
				
				<p>Within the design phase, I experienced a major challenge in garnering buy-in on a single concept; many members of the NutrientStar team seemed to have trouble imagining a concept existing in application. In order to circumvent this, I created a series of mockups to showcase how logos could potentially appear in ads or physical/digital mediums. These were extremely well received by the team and were an effective strategy in aiding the committee select a single design.</p>

				<h2>Visual System</h2>
				
				<p>With a logo successfully approved, I was given free rein to further develop the supporting visual system towards my vision. Within the system I developed the color scheme, typography &amp; photography styles, icon library, and additional supporting graphics. These were utilized to create working presentation templates and amassed into an overarching style guide, which would assist in developing new materials within the same visual system.</p>

				<h2>Results</h2>
				
				<p>The visual system was adopted and put in use to varying levels of success. As can be seen on the program website, some minor liberties were taken by other designers who put the system into effect, however the core visual identity still shines through. Additional materials like this TV spot further demonstrate the applied tenants of the identity, specifically the photography style adapted for film and logo application techniques.</p>
