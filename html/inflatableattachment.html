		<p>Abstract – Object constraint is a common issue across all vehicles on the market today. Passengers want to mount devices such as smartphones, tablets, and navigation systems to dashboards and seatbacks; they want to prevent cargo from tipping or sliding in their trunk and other storage spaces as their vehicle moves. Traditional attachments are generally heavy, clunky, and obtrusive devices. They often require difficult/intricate configuration, are not integrated directly into the vehicle, and are object-specific. While vehicle manufacturers constantly seek new and innovative features to attract buyers and improve the user experience, integrated object constraint systems have largely been ignored. Inflatable devices are an attractive choice for such an application, as they are lightweight, easily stowed, and can be self-deployed. Do to their relative ease of fabrication and customization, as well as their moderate force output, pneumatic actuators have recently become the subject of emerging research. This increase in support and broadening knowledge base makes these actuators a more viable option for developing an attachment to fit our needs. This paper will present the design for an array of pneumatic bending actuators that can constrain various non-specific objects against a surface when inflated, while returning to a smooth, unobtrusive state when uninflated. A large number of concepts were created and then down-selected to the final design – a pneumatic bending actuator nested within a trench that acts as a locking mechanism when the actuator is partially constrained by an object. These actuators can be configured into an array and the resulting system can constrain objects without pushing them away from the surface. A proof-of-concept was fabricated by pouring silicon into 3D-printed molds and the holding and locking forces were then experimentally characterized as functions of pressure and percent of the actuator that was constrained. This technology will be the first step in directly implementing an array into the unused interior surfaces (dashboards, seatbacks, trunk space, etc.) that can act as a lightweight, universal object constraint that requires minimal manual configuration, can be easily stowed/deployed, and improves the overall driving experience.</p>
		
		<p>A ‘vehicle attachment’ is any device that is used to constrain an objects motion within a moving vehicle. Typical attachments include things like dashboard mounts for mobile devices, cargo mats, built-in racks/mounting points, hanging-seatback pockets, and cup holders. These constraints are used to prevent objects from tipping/sliding around a moving vehicle, and to hold objects at a specific position/orientation when the visibility of that object is necessary (i.e. navigation systems).While these vehicle attachments are generally successful at preforming their desired functions, there are several drawbacks to the current state of attachments. Traditional attachments are largely object specific; the device that holds your phone is not the same as the one that prevents your groceries from sliding around your trunk.  A dashboard mount for a certain mobile phone may not even work for similar devices like tablets or navigation systems. They are also obtrusive and are not easily stored when not in use; a hanging seatback pocket may be great at holding loose objects, but even when it’s not in use it will be taking up valuable legroom in the vehicle. Traditional attachments often times require manual configuration, which becomes especially difficult or even impossible when a vehicle is in use.</p>
		
		<p>Inflatable grippers, or Pneumatic Bending Actuators (PBAs) have several attributes that could allow them to be preferable alternatives to traditional attachments.. PBAs are elastic, finger-like structures that utilize pneumatic networks (PneuNets)[1], a series of interconnected inflatable chambers, to curl around a flexible but inextensible layer when an internal pressure is applied[2] (Figure 1). They are currently used in a variety of applications, ranging from manufacturing, to surgery[2], to physical rehabilitation[3]. PBAs are most often used as grippers to pick up objects, however they have been implemented in other applications, such as generating locomotion[4] or playing the piano[5]. They are relatively lightweight, and are easily deployed and stowed by applying a small internal pressure. They excel at holding irregular objects and therefore can be used as universal (non-object specific) attachments for our application. They are also extremely flexible and could potentially be squeezed into small storage spaces when depressurized, which is again ideal for vehicles in which space is highly valued. This technology, however,  is currently lacking: 1.A means of controlling object orientation without an additional mechanical system. 2.An established method of self-deploying from an unobtrusive storage space.When PBAs are being used to pick up objects, they are traditionally implemented at the ends of mechanical arms, which help control orientation/position. Also, for these standard applications they have no need to enter an unobtrusive, stowed state when not in use</p>
		
		<p>The objective of this work is to utilize the established principles of PBAs to develop an attachment that can both constrain a non-specific object coincident to a surface without altering its initial orientation, and can be stored in a smooth, unobtrusive state such that it could be integrated directly into an unused surface within a vehicle when depressurized. The deployment of the attachment should also be as quick and requiring as little manual configuration as possible, outside of inflating the device.To achieve this objective, the following procedure was used: First, preform a literature review on existing inflatable attachments, and then more specifically on the current state of PBAs. A large number of concepts were generated and then systematically down-selected based on several selection criteria. Based on the selected concept, the existing technology, and the design requirements, a final design was created. A proof-of-concept was then fabricated and finally, several key attributes of the design were experimentally characterized.
		</p>
		
		<p>Before PBAs were selected as the basis of the design, a large number of inflatable attachment concepts were generated based on a variety of different methods of attaching objects to a surface (Figure 2). Some of the methods that were looked at were compression, i.e. inflating a surface or an array of balloons around an object to hold it in place, suction, creating a vacuum to hold an object against a surface, and entrapment, inflating some sort of structure to bend or pop up around an object and thus constraining it in place. Other methods explored include granular jamming and locking between two mating inflatable structures. Sixteen different concepts based on these various principles were more fully developed and were then down-selected to a final design.</p>
		
		<p>The concept down-selection was based on criteria that were divided into three categories. The first category was the concept’s physical performance as an attachment, i.e. its ability to successfully constrain motion, hold objects of various shapes/sizes, the magnitude of the forces it could generate, etc. The second category is the user’s experience with the attachment, which includes things like the number of steps required to attach/remove an object, the time it would take to deploy/stow the attachment, its aesthetic, etc. The last category is the practicality of the project, which includes cost, complexity, fabrication time, etc. Each criterion was weighted on a scale from 1-10 (least important to most important) and each concept was graded on its hypothesized level of success at fulfilling said criterion. This grade was multiplied by the weight of the criteria and resulting scores were summed to generate a total score for each concept. The highest scoring concept was then chosen. It was in this way that the PBA, by means of entrapment, was selected as optimal baseline for the design.</p>
		
		<p>As previously stated, current PBA-based grippers excel at holding irregular objects with minimal required pressure, however they lack inherent methods of orientation control and need to be integrated into a surface for our application. For our design, several features of a standard PBA were customized to better fit the intended application, the PBA was integrated into a plastic trench to allow for object orientation control (Figure 3), and then multiple trench-finger assemblies were combined to create an array with a flat face (Figure 7). The resulting surface can by pressurized to hold objects against its face, while featuring to a flat state when uninflated.</p>
		
		<p>Our Pneumatic Bending Actuator follows the principles of standard PBA design, a pneumatic network of inflatable chambers that bend around an inextensible layer when pressurized, however several key design decisions were made to optimize the performance for our application. The inflatable chambers are split (otherwise known as the ‘fast PneuNet’ variation) instead or being connected (‘slow PneuNet’ variation)[5] (Figure 4). Fast PneuNet (fPN) actuators have been demonstrated to not only actuate faster than the sPN variation, but also exert greater forces for a given pressure[5]. These characteristics help provide better deployment times and a greater ability to successfully constrain objects. An unintended consequence of choosing the fPN design over the sPN, however, is that the change in volume of the PBA is smaller for a given degree of bending[5]. Usually this is considered an advantage, as it allows for a higher number of actuation cycles before failure[5], however a larger change in volume is necessary for our PBA to properly lock within the trench, as will be discussed shortly. </p>
		
		<p>In order to account for this, the inflatable chambers are designed to be longer than is usually necessary for them to actuate, which results in a larger surface area within the sides of the inflatable chambers, which allows greater sideways expansion into the walls of the trench as the PBA actuates. Another distinct feature is the relatively large chamber (designated as the ‘Air Intake Chamber’) located on the end of the PBA (Figure 5). This larger chamber allows for a needle to be easily inserted so that air can be pumped in, while the thicker walls provide a more rigid structure that can be press fit into the trench and act as an anchor point to hold the assembly together. Lastly, while it has been shown that a textured/ridged surface on the inextensible layer creates higher friction against an object and is more beneficial for gripping[3], this layer was kept smooth. The flat surface is an important feature for the design to maintain, as we desire it to be smooth and unobtrusive when deflated.</p>
		
		<p>The trench (Figure 6) is an APS plastic housing for the PBA that serves as a locking mechanism for its motion. Its three primary features are the ‘Retaining Lip,’ which runs along the upper walls of the trench and prevents the PBA from actuating past a certain pressure, the ‘Air Intake Chamber Housing,’ which holds the Air Intake Chamber, and a hole in the back wall that allows for a needle to pass through and be inserted into the Air Intake Chamber. The locking mechanism ensures the PBA bends around and clamps down on the object instead of lifting/tilting it when it bends.</p>
		
		<p>Finally, a complete array can be assembled from the individual PBA-trench assemblies (Figure 7). In an array configuration, the PBAs can entrap an object from all sides, while returning to a smooth surface when deflated. The modular nature of the design can allow for many potential array configurations.</p>
		
		<p>When unconstrained, our PBA operates in a similar fashion to standard PBAs. A needle is inserted through the hole in the back wall of the trench into the Air Intake chamber and air is pumped into the structure. The pneumatic network of chambers inflate as the pressure increases and the interference between the chambers caused the actuator to bend around the inextensible layer, which in our case is a slip of paper embedded into the top layer of the elastic structure. It only requires ~2 psi to complete its full range of motion.However, when an object is placed on top of the PBA, covering some percent of its surface, the locking mechanism within the trench comes into play. Under low pressures ( 2 psi), the PBA will naturally bend around an object that is placed on top of it. The portion that is constrained underneath the object will remain flat as there is not enough pressure for those chambers to inflate and lift/tip the constraining object and complete its full range of motion (lightest object considered is 4 ounces, the average weight of a cell phone). This means the object will remain flat (maintaining its initial orientation) while the PBA bends around it. However, this only works at low pressure ( 2 psi) and at these low pressures, there is not enough clamping force generated by the unconstrained portion of the PBA to adequately constrain an object. At higher pressures (2-4 psi), the clamping force becomes useful, however without a locking mechanism the chambers underneath the object will naturally try to bend upwards, and for lighter objects (~4 ounces) the bending force will be great enough to tip the object and alter its orientation. This is especially an issue when an array is considered, if an object placed onto the array is large enough to completely cover some PBAs, these PBAs will have now ay to bend around the object and will be forced push the object up and away from the array as pressure is increased.</p>
		
		<p>The trench resolves this issue by acting as a locking mechanism at higher pressures. As mentioned earlier, the PBA design incorporates longer chambers that allows them to expand sideways as well as lengthwise as pressure increases. Once the sideways inflation of the PBA is large enough, the Retaining Lip in the trench will engage the expanding champers (Figure 8), generating a locking force that counters the bending force such that increased pressures will no longer be able to lift/tip the constraining object. Once the finger becomes locked within the trench, the pressure can be continuously increased, thus creating useful clamping force, without sacrificing object orientation (Figure 9).</p>
		
		<p>The PBA is fabricated in a 2-part molding process in which silicon is poured into three 3D-printed ABS molds. The inflatable chambers and the inextensible layer are cast separately; a slip of paper is cured with the inextensible layer to make it inextensible (Figure 10). Then, the cured components are bonded together with additional silicon and cured again. The trench is 3D–printed separately.</p>
		
		<p>The PBA is made of Ecoflex® 00-50, which was selected do to its high flexibility and relatively short cure time at room temperature[6] (Table 1). The silicon comes in a Part A and Part B, which must be mixed in 1A:1B ratio. There are three ABS plastic molds, the Upper and Lower Chamber Molds, which are printed separately but joined together when casting, and the Tray Mold. The process also requires Ease Release® 205 mold release, acetone (optional), a mixing jar, a centrifuge (or paint-mixer), a vacuum, a scale, and paper.</p>
		
		<p>Once all required materials are in hand, the first step is to prepare the surface of the molds. If a high quality surface is desired, the 3D-printed ABS molds should be given an acetone fume bath for 2-3 hours to smooth out their surfaces. This process is not is absolutely necessary, however if it is preformed, the molds should be allowed to sit out for at least 24 hours before use to allow them to completely re-harden. The thin walls in the upper chamber mold become especially fragile after an acetone fume path and, if not given enough time to solidify there is a higher chance that they will break in the molding process. Regardless of whether the acetone fume bath is undertaken or not, the next step is to release the molds. The molds are thoroughly coated with the mold release and allowed to air dry for 5-10 minutes. The surface finish will also naturally improve over time if the molds are continually reused, as a silicon film will begin to build up on them. The next step is to prepare the elastomer. Around 30 g of silicon (15 g Part A, 15 g Part B) is needed for one PBA. Both parts are poured into a mixing jar and the jar is placed in a centrifuge (or paint mixer) for 3-5 minutes. Once thoroughly mixed, the jar is removed, the lid is taken off, and it is placed in the vacuum. The vacuum is pressurized to 1.0 MPa for 2-3 minutes. It should be visibly bubbling once it reaches ~0.8 MPa, this removes most of the air trapped within the mixture. The silicon is now ready to be poured, at this point here should be at least 10 minutes left in the pot life of the silicon. The Upper and Lower Chamber Molds are assembled; they can be fused together by applying a small amount of acetone to the mating faces and pressing them together. This is optional as it will ensure there are no leaks, however it will also make it much more difficult to remove the molded part without breaking the molds. The silicon is slowly poured into the Chamber Mold, making slow passes along its length and allowing the silicon to completely settle before pouring again. This minimizes the amount of bubbles in the mold. Once the Chamber Mold is full, the overflow on the top of the mold is carefully wiped off. The Tray Mold is evenly filled 50% of the way up with the remaining silicon. If the Chamber Molds have not been fused together, a weight is placed on top of the molds to press them together and minimize leakage. Allow the molds 3 hours to cure. If there is still noticeable leakage in the Chamber Mold, it can be topped off with additional silicon, even if it has already cured. However, after topping off the mold, it must be given an additional 3 hours from that point to re-cure. After the casts are completely cured, the Chamber molds are separated and the chambers are carefully removed, the cast in the Tray Mold is not touched. Another ~5 g of silicon is mixed using the previous procedure. A very thin layer, just large enough to cover the surface of the silicon, is then poured into the Tray Mold. A slip of paper is placed into the tray mold and pressed down to ensure there is not air trapped underneath. Another thin layer of silicon, again just enough to cover the surface of the paper, is poured into the mold. The chamber cast is then placed into the tray, and remaining silicon is poured around the edges, sealing the components together. Any overflow is carefully wiped away and the component is left to cure. After 3 hours, the PBA is completed is easily removed from the tray. If any overflow has cured to the PBA, it is then carefully cut away.</p>
		
		<p>Three primary experiments are preformed to characterize the basic functionality of the design; the bending &amp; locking motions are validated, the locking force is measured, and clamping force is measured</p>
		
		<p>The bending and locking functions are validated by constraining a PBA to a certain degree (based on the number of free chambers) (Figure 11) and applying an internal pressure. The orientation of the constraining object is observed and visually confirmed to remain unchanged throughout the pressurization process (Figure 12). Once the desired pressure is reached, the object is removed and it is checked that the locking mechanism is in effect if the PBA retains it shape. This procedure is repeated for each level of constraint at 2, 3, and 4 psi (holding the PBA at pressures higher than 4 psi was found to permanently deform it over time). It was observed to successfully bend and lock as intended at all tested combinations of constraint and pressure.</p>
		
		<p>Next, the locking force is characterized. A pulley is mounted above the to the PBA and a string is tied to the end of the PBA. The other end runs around the pulley and is tied to a receptacle (cup) to hold weight. Counter weights are added to the string to balance the weight of the cup and ensure no initial force is acting on the PBA (Figure 13). The PBA is constrained to a certain degree and a pressurized such that it locks into the trench. Weight is added to the cup until the locked portion of the PBA is pulled out of the trench, the weight that causes the release is recorded. This procedure is repeated for 50-100% constrained at 2, 3, ad 4 psi. In this manner, the maximum locking force is measured as a function of pressure and % constrained (Figure 14).</p>
		
		<p>It is observed that the maximum locking force (release force) linearly increases both as pressure increases and as the % constrained increases and that the maximum locking forces will always be well above the bending force applied due to pressure.</p>
		
		<p>The holding force for the PBAs is then characterized in a similar procedure. A simple array is constructed with two PBAs and the pulley is now tied to a plate instead of directly to a PBA. Counter weights are again added to balance the pulley system. A ruler is erected adjacent to the edge of the plate so its vertical displacement can be measured (Figure 15). The PBA array is inflated to a given pressure such that the PBAs bend around the plate, lock into the trenches, and apply a clamping force down in the plate. Weight is now slowly added to the cup at steady increments and the vertical displacement of the late is recorded until maximum holding force is reached and the PBAs release the plate. This procedure is repeated for 12.5-50% constrained at 2, 3, and 4 psi. The level of constraint is increased by increasing the sized of the plate. Based on these results, the holding force can be recorded as a function of vertical displacement, pressure, and % constraint (Figure 18).</p>
		
		<p>A measure of stiffness and clamping force for the PBA can also be characterized and a relatively accurate model the holding force can be generated. By plotting the holding force against the square root of the displacement, it is seen that that there is a linear relationship between these measures (within a limited range of motion). By adding linear fit lines to the plot, a measure of ‘stiffness’ (slope) and clamping force (y-in tersect), the maximum force such that there is no displacement, can be calculated. (Figure 17) These models can now be used to predict the holding force of the PBAs at a given displacement with relative accuracy, which can be seen by plotting them against the experimental data at each measured displacement (Figure 18).</p>
		
		<p>These measures of ‘stiffness’ and clamping force can also be plotted as functions of pressure and % constraint (Figure 19). This shows that the stiffness is linearly related to the pressure and % constraint, while the clamping force is exponentially related to the pressure, but has no clear relationship to the % constrained based on our data. From these plots we can conclude that, depending on the level of constraint, an almost 50% increase in the stiffness of the PBA can be achieved from a relatively small increase in the pressure.</p>
		
		<p>In this paper, a design for inflatable attachment based on principles of pneumatic bending actuators was presented. The combination of unique features with the PBA and the locking mechanism provide by the addition of the trench system allow the attachment to constrain object flat against its face without altering their orientation and be easily integrated into a flat surface. The actuation, locking, and holding forces were experimentally characterized and measures of stiffness and clamping forces were able to be derived and serve as accurate predictors for the holding force at a given displacement. There is opportunity for many additional characterizations to be preformed in the future, including measuring the resistance to tipping/slipping and measuring the performance of an array at different angles. The principles of the work will serve as the basis for an inflatable attachment that can be integrated directly into any unused surface within a vehicle and easily constrain objects.
