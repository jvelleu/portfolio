	About: NutrientStar is a certification program for nitrogen management tools.
	
	Brief: Design the visual identity and supporting style guide for NutrientStar. The program reguired a logo/seal that could exist in both a digital form on a website and as a seal on partnering products that are approved to be nitrogen efficient according to the programs standards.
	
	My Role: Lead Designer
	
	Research: Logos both similar green certification programs were collected to observe common tendencies, source inspiration, and identify strategies to stand out witha unique mark. Additionally, logos and packaging of products ther the NutientStar could appear on were observed in order to better understand the environmnets the logo could exist in.
	
	Concepts: A huge ammount of concepts were generated and many different directions were explored. A curated selection of these concepts were presented at several stages of design reviews. In thse review, mockups were used to aid in estalishing context for the proposed logos; these were recieved enthusiastically by the strategic team.
	
	Branding: After the promary logo/seal was selected, the supporting visual identity was built up around the mark. The complete set of visual guidelines were defined in the styleguide.
	
	Result: The proposed identity was accepted and is in use at www.NutrientStar.com.
	
	Tools: Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign
